     * <p>Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of just
     * within your window. Not all video targets support this function. When
     * capturing is enabled, the current window will get all mouse events, but
     * unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is not
     * restrained to your window.</p>
     *
     * <p>This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in
     * your application and others on the system--so you should use this function
     * sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to track the
     * mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user releases a mouse
     * button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods
     * of time, such as the entire time your app is running. For that, you should
     * probably use SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode() or SDL_SetWindowGrab(), depending
     * on your goals.</p>
     *
     * <p>While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
     * current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
     * bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only allowed
     * for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while capturing, the
     * capture will be disabled automatically.</p>
     *
     * <p>While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
     * {@code SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE} flag set.</p>
     *
     * <p>Please note that as of SDL 2.0.22, SDL will attempt to "auto capture" the
     * mouse while the user is pressing a button; this is to try and make mouse
     * behavior more consistent between platforms, and deal with the common case
     * of a user dragging the mouse outside of the window. This means that if you
     * are calling SDL_CaptureMouse() only to deal with this situation, you no
     * longer have to (although it is safe to do so). If this causes problems for
     * your app, you can disable auto capture by setting the
     * {@code SDL_HINT_MOUSE_AUTO_CAPTURE} hint to zero.</p>
