 * Definitions from file SDL_haptic.h
 *
 * <p>The SDL haptic subsystem allows you to control haptic (force feedback)
 * devices.</p>
 *
 * <p>The basic usage is as follows:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Initialize the subsystem ({@link SdlSubSystemConst#SDL_INIT_HAPTIC SDL_INIT_HAPTIC}).</li>
 *     <li>Open a haptic device.
 *         <ol>
 *             <li>SDL_HapticOpen() to open from index.</li>
 *             <li>SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick() to open from an existing joystick.</li>
 *         </ol>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Create an effect ({@link SDL_HapticEffect}).</li>
 *     <li>Upload the effect with SDL_HapticNewEffect().</li>
 *     <li>Run the effect with SDL_HapticRunEffect().</li>
 *     <li>(optional) Free the effect with SDL_HapticDestroyEffect().</li>
 *     <li>Close the haptic device with SDL_HapticClose().</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Simple rumble example:</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Open the device
 * SDL_Haptic haptic = SDL_HapticOpen(0);
 * if (haptic == null) {
 *     throw new IllegalStateException("The device isn't haptic");
 * }
 * try {
 *     // Initialize simple rumble
 *     if (SDL_HapticRumbleInit(haptic) != 0) {
 *         throw new IllegalStateException("The device doesn't support rumble effects");
 *     }
 *
 *     // Play effect at 50% strength for 2 seconds
 *     if (SDL_HapticRumblePlay(haptic, 0.5F, 2000) != 0) {
 *         throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to play rumble effect");
 *     }
 *     SDL_Delay(2000);
 * } finally {
 *     // Clean up
 *     SDL_HapticClose(haptic);
 * }
