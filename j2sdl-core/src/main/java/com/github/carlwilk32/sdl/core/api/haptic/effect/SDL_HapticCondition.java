/**
 * A structure containing a template for a Condition effect.
 *
 * <p>The struct handles the following effects:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link SDL_HapticEffectType#SDL_HAPTIC_SPRING SDL_HAPTIC_SPRING}: Effect based on axes position.</li>
 *     <li>{@link SDL_HapticEffectType#SDL_HAPTIC_DAMPER SDL_HAPTIC_DAMPER}: Effect based on axes velocity.</li>
 *     <li>{@link SDL_HapticEffectType#SDL_HAPTIC_INERTIA SDL_HAPTIC_INERTIA}: Effect based on axes acceleration.</li>
 *     <li>{@link SDL_HapticEffectType#SDL_HAPTIC_FRICTION SDL_HAPTIC_FRICTION}: Effect based on axes movement.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Direction is handled by condition internals instead of a direction member.
 * The condition effect specific members have three parameters.  The first
 * refers to the X axis, the second refers to the Y axis and the third
 * refers to the Z axis.  The right terms refer to the positive side of the
 * axis and the left terms refer to the negative side of the axis.  Please
 * refer to the {@link SDL_HapticDirection} diagram for which side is positive and
 * which is negative.</p>
