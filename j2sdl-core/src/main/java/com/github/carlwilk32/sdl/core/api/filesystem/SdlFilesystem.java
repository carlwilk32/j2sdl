     *
     * <p><b>Mac OS X and iOS Specific Functionality:</b> If the application is in a
     * ".app" bundle, this function returns the Resource directory (e.g.
     * MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/). This behaviour can be overridden by adding
     * a property to the Info.plist file. Adding a string key with the name
     * {@code SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE} with a supported value will change the
     * behaviour.</p>
     *
     * <p>Supported values for the {@code SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE} property (Given an
     * application in /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app):</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li><p>{@code resource}: bundle resource directory (the default). For example:</p>
     *         <p>{@code /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources}</p></li>
     *     <li><p>{@code bundle}: the Bundle directory. For example:</p>
     *         <p>{@code /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/}</p></li>
     *     <li><p>{@code parent}: the containing directory of the bundle. For example:</p>
     *         <p>{@code /Applications/SDLApp/}</p></li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Nintendo 3DS Specific Functionality</b>: This function returns "romfs"
     * directory of the application as it is uncommon to store resources outside
     * the executable. As such it is not a writable directory.</p>
     *
     * <p>The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\' on
     * Windows, '/' on most other platforms).</p>
     *

     * directory. {@code null} will be returned on error or when the platform
     * doesn't implement this functionality, call SDL_GetError() for more
     * information.

     *         changes for an app once you've decided on it.</li>
     *     <li>Unicode characters are legal, as long as it's UTF-8 encoded, but...</li>
     *     <li>...only use letters, numbers, and spaces. Avoid punctuation like "Game
     *         Name 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!" ... "Game Name 2" is sufficient.</li>
