 * <p>This struct is exclusively for the
 * {@link SDL_HapticEffectType#SDL_HAPTIC_CUSTOM SDL_HAPTIC_CUSTOM} effect.</p>
 *
 * <p>A custom force feedback effect is much like a periodic effect, where the
 * application can define its exact shape.  You will have to allocate the
 * data yourself.  Data should consist of channels * samples Uint16 samples.</p>
 *
 * <p>If channels is one, the effect is rotated using the defined direction.
 * Otherwise it uses the samples in data for the different axes.</p>
