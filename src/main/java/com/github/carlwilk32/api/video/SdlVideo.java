     * these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:</p>
     *
     * - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
     * this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current
     * before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or
     * create a second context, you should assume that any existing function
     * pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a
     * Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer
     * this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to
     * work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy
     * of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.
     * - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
     * context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
     * This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
     * look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-null result that
     * is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
     * available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
     * existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),
     * or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function
     * as core functionality.
     * - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return null if a function
     * isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
     * extensions you use, and if you get a null anyway, act as if that
     * extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you
     * can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.
     * - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
     * Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
     * make the same promises about function pointers.
     * - OpenGL function pointers must be declared {@code APIENTRY} as in the example
     * code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
     * platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.
     *
