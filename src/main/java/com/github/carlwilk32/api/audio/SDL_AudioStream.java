/**
 * <p>SDL_AudioStream is a new audio conversion interface.</p>

 * <p>The benefits vs SDL_AudioCVT:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>it can handle resampling data in chunks without generating
 *         artifacts, when it doesn't have the complete buffer available.</li>
 *     <li>it can handle incoming data in any variable size.</li>
 *     <li>You push data as you have it, and pull it when you need it</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is opaque to the outside world.</p>
