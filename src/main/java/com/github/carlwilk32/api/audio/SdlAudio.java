     *
     * <p>Managing the audio spec via 'desired' and 'obtained':</p>
     *
     * <p>When filling in the desired audio spec structure:</p>
     *
     * - {@code desired->freq} should be the frequency in sample-frames-per-second (Hz).
     * - {@code desired->format} should be the audio format ({@code AUDIO_S16SYS}, etc).
     * - {@code desired->samples} is the desired size of the audio buffer, in _sample
     * frames_ (with stereo output, two samples--left and right--would make a
     * single sample frame). This number should be a power of two, and may be
     * adjusted by the audio driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.
     * Good values seem to range between 512 and 8096 inclusive, depending on
     * the application and CPU speed. Smaller values reduce latency, but can
     * lead to underflow if the application is doing heavy processing and cannot
     * fill the audio buffer in time. Note that the number of sample frames is
     * directly related to time by the following formula: `ms =
     * (sampleframes*1000)/freq`
     * - {@code desired->size} is the size in _bytes_ of the audio buffer, and is
     * calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.
     * - {@code desired->silence} is the value used to set the buffer to silence, and is
     * calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.
     * - {@code desired->callback} should be set to a function that will be called when
     * the audio device is ready for more data. It is passed a pointer to the
     * audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer. This function
     * usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should protect data
     * structures that it accesses by calling SDL_LockAudioDevice() and
     * SDL_UnlockAudioDevice() in your code. Alternately, you may pass a NULL
     * pointer here, and call SDL_QueueAudio() with some frequency, to queue
     * more audio samples to be played (or for capture devices, call
     * SDL_DequeueAudio() with some frequency, to obtain audio samples).
     * - {@code desired->userdata} is passed as the first parameter to your callback
     * function. If you passed a NULL callback, this value is ignored.
     *
     * <p>{@code allowed_changes} can have the following flags OR'd together:</p>
     *
     * - {@code SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE}
     * - {@code SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE}
     * - {@code SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE}
     * - {@code SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_SAMPLES_CHANGE}
     * - {@code SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE}
     *
     * <p>These flags specify how SDL should behave when a device cannot offer a
     * specific feature. If the application requests a feature that the hardware
     * doesn't offer, SDL will always try to get the closest equivalent.</p>
     *
     * <p>For example, if you ask for float32 audio format, but the sound card only
     * supports int16, SDL will set the hardware to int16. If you had set
     * SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE, SDL will change the format in the {@code obtained}
     * structure. If that flag was *not* set, SDL will prepare to convert your
     * callback's float32 audio to int16 before feeding it to the hardware and
     * will keep the originally requested format in the {@code obtained} structure.</p>
     *
     * <p>The resulting audio specs, varying depending on hardware and on what
     * changes were allowed, will then be written back to {@code obtained}.</p>
     *
     * <p>If your application can only handle one specific data format, pass a zero
     * for {@code allowed_changes} and let SDL transparently handle any differences.</p>
     *
     * @param device         a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName() or a
     *                       driver-specific name as appropriate. NULL requests the most
     *                       reasonable default device.

     * Load the audio data of a WAVE file into memory.
     *
     * <p>Loading a WAVE file requires {@code src}, {@code spec}, {@code audio_buf} and {@code audio_len} to
     * be valid pointers. The entire data portion of the file is then loaded into
     * memory and decoded if necessary.</p>
     *
     * <p>If {@code freesrc} is non-zero, the data source gets automatically closed and
     * freed before the function returns.</p>
     *
     * <p>Supported formats are RIFF WAVE files with the formats PCM (8, 16, 24, and
     * 32 bits), IEEE Float (32 bits), Microsoft ADPCM and IMA ADPCM (4 bits), and
     * A-law and mu-law (8 bits). Other formats are currently unsupported and
     * cause an error.</p>
     *
     * <p>If this function succeeds, the pointer returned by it is equal to {@code spec}
     * and the pointer to the audio data allocated by the function is written to
     * {@code audio_buf} and its length in bytes to {@code audio_len}. The SDL_AudioSpec
     * members {@code freq}, {@code channels}, and {@code format} are set to the values of the audio
     * data in the buffer. The {@code samples} member is set to a sane default and all
     * others are set to zero.</p>
     *
     * <p>It's necessary to use SDL_FreeWAV() to free the audio data returned in
     * {@code audio_buf} when it is no longer used.</p>
     *
     * <p>Because of the underspecification of the .WAV format, there are many
     * problematic files in the wild that cause issues with strict decoders. To
     * provide compatibility with these files, this decoder is lenient in regards
     * to the truncation of the file, the fact chunk, and the size of the RIFF
     * chunk. The hints {@code SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE},
     * {@code SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION}, and {@code SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK} can be used to
     * tune the behavior of the loading process.</p>
     *
     * <p>Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values in
     * the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error. Additionally, any
     * critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading process
     * with an error. The function returns NULL on error and in all cases (with
     * the exception of {@code src} being NULL), an appropriate error message will be
     * set.</p>
     *
     * <p>It is required that the data source supports seeking.</p>
     *
     * <p>Example:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * SDL_LoadWAV_RW(SDL_RWFromFile("sample.wav", "rb"), 1, spec, buf, len);
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Note that the SDL_LoadWAV macro does this same thing for you, but in a less
     * messy way:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * SDL_LoadWAV("sample.wav", spec, buf, len);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param src      The data source for the WAVE data
     * @param freesrc  If non-zero, SDL will _always_ free the data source
     * @param spec     An SDL_AudioSpec that will be filled in with the wave file's
     *                 format details
     * @param audioBuf A pointer filled with the audio data, allocated by the
     *                 function.
     * @param audioLen A pointer filled with the length of the audio data buffer
     *                 in bytes
     * @return This function, if successfully called, returns {@code spec}, which will
     * be filled with the audio data format of the wave source data.
     * {@code audio_buf} will be filled with a pointer to an allocated buffer
     * containing the audio data, and {@code audio_len} is filled with the
     * length of that audio buffer in bytes.
     *
     * <p>This function returns NULL if the .WAV file cannot be opened, uses
     * an unknown data format, or is corrupt; call SDL_GetError() for
     * more information.</p>

     * Dequeue more audio on non-callback devices.
     *
     * <p>If you are looking to queue audio for output on a non-callback playback
     * device, you want SDL_QueueAudio() instead. SDL_DequeueAudio() will always
     * return 0 if you use it with playback devices.</p>
     *
     * <p>SDL offers two ways to retrieve audio from a capture device: you can either
     * supply a callback that SDL triggers with some frequency as the device
     * records more audio data, (push method), or you can supply no callback, and
     * then SDL will expect you to retrieve data at regular intervals (pull
     * method) with this function.</p>
     *
     * <p>There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of
     * exhaustion of address space. Data from the device will keep queuing as
     * necessary without further intervention from you. This means you will
     * eventually run out of memory if you aren't routinely dequeueing data.</p>
     *
     * <p>Capture devices will not queue data when paused; if you are expecting to
     * not need captured audio for some length of time, use SDL_PauseAudioDevice()
     * to stop the capture device from queueing more data. This can be useful
     * during, say, level loading times. When unpaused, capture devices will start
     * queueing data from that point, having flushed any capturable data available
     * while paused.</p>
     *
     * <p>This function is thread-safe, but dequeueing from the same device from two
     * threads at once does not promise which thread will dequeue data first.</p>
     *
     * <p>You may not dequeue audio from a device that is using an
     * application-supplied callback; doing so returns an error. You have to use
     * the audio callback, or dequeue audio with this function, but not both.</p>
