/**
 * Definitions from file SDL_joystick.h
 *
 * <p>Include file for SDL joystick event handling</p>
 *
 * <p>The term "deviceIndex" identifies currently plugged in joystick devices between 0 and SDL_NumJoysticks(), with the exact joystick
 * behind a deviceIndex changing as joysticks are plugged and unplugged.</p>
 *
 * <p>The term "instanceId" is the current instantiation of a joystick device in the system, if the joystick is removed and then re-inserted
 * then it will get a new instanceId, instanceId's are monotonically increasing identifiers of a joystick plugged in.</p>
 *
 * <p>The term "playerIndex" is the number assigned to a player on a specific
 * controller. For XInput controllers this returns the XInput user index.
 * Many joysticks will not be able to supply this information.</p>
 *
 * <p>The term JoystickGUID is a stable 128-bit identifier for a joystick device that does not change over time, it identifies class of
 * the device (a X360 wired controller for example). This identifier is platform dependent.</p>
 *
 * <p>In order to use these functions, SDL_Init() must have been called
 * with the {@link SdlSubSystemConst#SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK} flag.  This causes SDL to scan the system
 * for joysticks, and load appropriate drivers.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you would like to receive joystick updates while the application
 * is in the background, you should set the following hint before calling
 * SDL_Init(): SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS</p>
