     * Dynamically load the Vulkan loader library.
     *
     * <p>This should be called after initializing the video driver, but before
     * creating any Vulkan windows. If no Vulkan loader library is loaded, the
     * default library will be loaded upon creation of the first Vulkan window.</p>
     *
     * <p>It is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with libvulkan instead
     * of explicitly loading it at run time. This will work with SDL provided the
     * application links to a dynamic library and both it and SDL use the same
     * search path.</p>
     *
     * <p>If you specify a non-null {@code path}, an application should retrieve all of the
     * Vulkan functions it uses from the dynamic library using
     * SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr unless you can guarantee {@code path} points
     * to the same vulkan loader library the application linked to.</p>
     *
     * <p>On Apple devices, if {@code path} is null, SDL will attempt to find the
     * {@code vkGetInstanceProcAddr} address within all the Mach-O images of the current
     * process. This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan applications to
     * link with libvulkan (and historically MoltenVK was provided as a static
     * library). If it is not found, on macOS, SDL will attempt to load
     * {@code vulkan.framework/vulkan}, {@code libvulkan.1.dylib},
     * {@code MoltenVK.framework/MoltenVK}, and {@code libMoltenVK.dylib}, in that order. On
     * iOS, SDL will attempt to load {@code libMoltenVK.dylib}. Applications using a
     * dynamic framework or .dylib must ensure it is included in its application
     * bundle.</p>
     *
     * <p>On non-Apple devices, application linking with a static libvulkan is not
     * supported. Either do not link to the Vulkan loader or link to a dynamic
     * library version.</p>
