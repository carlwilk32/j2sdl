     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>"r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.</li>
     *     <li>"w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
     *         already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
     *         empty file.</li>
     *     <li>"a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
     *         file. The file is created if it does not exist.</li>
     *     <li>"r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
     *         exist.</li>
     *     <li>"w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
     *         the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
     *         treated as a new empty file.</li>
     *     <li>"a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
     *         performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
     *         overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
     *         anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
     *         back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
     * be included in the {@code mode} string. This additional "b" character can either
     * be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
     * modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
     * letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").
     * Additional characters may follow the sequence, although they should have no
     * effect. For example, "t" is sometimes appended to make explicit the file is
     * a text file.</p>
     *
     * <p>This function supports Unicode filenames, but they must be encoded in UTF-8
     * format, regardless of the underlying operating system.</p>
     *
